*Layer info for AIST ADP Process (10kA/cm2)
*** Author: Coenrad Fourie
*** Last Modification: 18 February 2014
*** Info: Created slight offsets to prevent inter-layer shorting in models
*** Info: Planarized layers added
*** Info: Corrected thickness of VIA6 (300 nm) and GP (400 nm)

* LAYERS
** Number is GDS layer number
** Name is layer as applied in geometry input file
** Bias is the mask-wafer offset of an object's border in this layer
** Thickness is the layer thickness in microns
** Lamba is the layer's penetration depth in microns
** Sigma is the layer's bulk conductivity (only for resistive layers, and not yet used)
** Order is the layer's order during wafer construction - the lowest layer starts at 0, but does not need to be Ground (as in ADP)
** Mask is the mask polarity: {1 = layer objects define material
**                             0 = layer objects not translated to model
**                            -1 = layer objects define cutots }
** Filmtype is the layer material typ: {S = superconductor, N = normal conductor, I = isolator, A = auxiliary/don't care }
** PlanarModel is the planarization model: {0 = no planarization, 1 = planarized (ISTEC-SRL CCP method)}
** HFilaments is the number of filaments segments are divided into over the height (overrides global HFilaments)
** LayerADD is the number of a layer of which objects are added to current layer (OR operation)
** LayerSUB is the number of a layer of which objects are subtracted from the current layer
** Colour is the DXF colour (for viewing purposes)
