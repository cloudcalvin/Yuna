        First clone the git repo:
        
        ```
        git clone https://rubenvanstaden@bitbucket.org/coldflux/yuna.git

        * Make sure Python is installed on your system:
        
        ## Fedora
        
        ```
        sudo dnf install python2-devel
        sudo dnf install python3-devel
        ```
        
        ## CentOS
        
        ```
        sudo yum install python-devel
        ```
        
        ## Ubuntu
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python-dev
        sudo apt-get install python3-dev
        ```
        
        * Install the necessary C++ compilers:
        
        ## Fedora
        
        ```
        sudo dnf install gcc-c++
        ```
        
        ## CentOS
        
        ```
        sudo yum install gcc-c++
        ```
        
        ## Ubuntu
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential
        ```
        
        * Install TKinter which is needed by Matplotlib:
        
        ## Fedora
        
        ```
        sudo dnf install tkinter
        ```
        
        ## Ubuntu
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python-tk
        ```
        
        * Next install the dependencies for Yuna:
        
        ```
        sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        * Then install Yuna on your system:
        
        ```
        sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        # Installing Yuna from PIP
        
        In order to use *import yuna*, we have to install the package **locally**,
        with:
        
        ```
        sudo pip install .
        ```
        
        We can also install the package in development mode with a symlink, so that
        changes to the source files will be immediately available to other users of the
        package on your system.
        
        ```
        sudo pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Publishing to PyPI
        
        The *setup.py* script is our main entry-point to register the package name op
        PyPI and upload source distributions.
        
        ## Packaging
        
        **Distutils** is still the standard tool for packaging in Python, but lacks
        features.
        
        **Setuptools** was developed to overcome *distutils'* limitations and is
        included in the setup.py file using *import setuptools*.
        
        # Debugging tools
        
        Install iPython for debugging:
        
        ```
        sudo dnf install ipython
        ```
        
        # GIT Tips
        
        To disregard small changes use:
        
        ```
        git checkout .
        ```
