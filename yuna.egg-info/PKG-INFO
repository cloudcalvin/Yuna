        ====
        
        In order to use *import yuna*, we have to install the package
        **locally**, with:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install .
        
        We can also install the package in development mode with a symlink, so
        that changes to the source files will be immediately available to other
        users of the package on your system.
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install -e .
        
        Puslishing to PyPI
        ------------------
        
        The *setup.py* script is our main entrypoint to register the package
        name op PyPI and upload source distrinutions.
        
        Packaging
        ---------
        
        **Distutils** is still the standard tool for packaging in Python, but
        lacks features.
        
        **Setuptools** was developed to overcome *distutils'* limitations and is
        included in the setup.py file using *import setuptools*.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        To install graph-tool:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get build-dep python3-graph-tool
        
        then download the source code, run the *autogen.sh* and then to
        configure for Python 3:
        
        ::
        
            ./configure PYTHON=python3
